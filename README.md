## What is this?

This app hides your mouse on your notebook while you type so you will not accidentally touch the touchpad and click somewhere. Yeah.. that's pretty what this does.

## How is this possible?

It is possible due to this great projects I used as libraries - [jnativehook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook) and [Java Native Access](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) and the beautiful try icon which I've taken from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/cs/barevn%C3%A9-pastelky-tu%C5%BEka-pero-3148812/)
